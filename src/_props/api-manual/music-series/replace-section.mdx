title: "Replace Section"
description: "Replace specific sections of generated music tracks"
openapi: "/api-manual/music-series/replace-section.json POST /api/generate/submit"

<Tip>
  1. After submission, a `task_id` will be returned. If you provided a `callback_url`, when the task status becomes `finished` or `failed`, a POST request will be sent to the `callback_url`.
  2. Regardless of whether `callback_url` is provided, you can retrieve the response result through the unified [Query Music Detail](/api-manual/music-series/query-music-detail) endpoint.
</Tip>

## Usage Guide

* This endpoint replaces a specific time range of an existing music track with new content
* Useful for editing verses, choruses, or any specific part of a generated track
* The replacement content is generated based on your prompt and style tags

## Parameter Details

* `task_id` (required): The original task ID from a completed music generation
* `audio_id` (required): The specific audio track identifier from the callback data
* `prompt` (required): Description of the replacement content (lyrics or musical description)
* `tags` (required): Style tags for the replacement section
* `title` (required): Title for the resulting track
* `infill_start_s` (required): Start time in seconds (minimum 0, up to 2 decimals)
* `infill_end_s` (required): End time in seconds (must be greater than start time)

## Developer Notes

* Ensure `infill_end_s` is always greater than `infill_start_s`
* The time range should be within the duration of the original track
* Use `full_lyrics` when you want to maintain lyrical consistency across the entire track

## Optional parameters

* `negative_tags` (string): Styles to exclude from the replacement section
* `full_lyrics` (string): Complete lyrics for the entire track after modification
* `callback_url` (string): Webhook URL for receiving completion notifications
