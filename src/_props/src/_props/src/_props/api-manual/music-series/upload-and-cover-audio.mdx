<Tip>
  1. After submission, a `task_id` will be returned. If you provided a `callback_url`, when the task status becomes `finished` or `failed`, a POST request will be sent to the `callback_url`.
  2. Regardless of whether `callback_url` is provided, you can retrieve the response result through the unified [Query Music Detail](/api-manual/music-series/query-music-detail) endpoint.
