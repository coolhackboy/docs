title: "Get Timestamped Lyrics"
description: "Retrieve synchronized lyrics with precise timestamps"

<Tip>
  1. After submission, a `task_id` will be returned. If you provided a `callback_url`, when the task status becomes `finished` or `failed`, a POST request will be sent to the `callback_url`.
  2. Regardless of whether `callback_url` is provided, you can retrieve the response result through the unified [Query Music Detail](/api-manual/music-series/query-music-detail) endpoint.

## Usage Guide

* This endpoint retrieves synchronized lyrics with precise timestamps for generated audio tracks
* Use this to create karaoke-style displays, subtitles, or lyric visualizations
* Requires a completed music generation task with vocals

## Parameter Details

* Required parameters:

  * `task_id`: The unique identifier from a previous music generation task

  * `audio_id`: The specific audio track identifier from the task result

* Both identifiers are obtained from the response of music generation endpoints or their callbacks

## Developer Notes

* This endpoint only works with audio tracks that contain vocals
* The `hoot_cer` (Character Error Rate) value indicates alignment precision - lower values mean better accuracy
* Use `waveform_data` for creating audio visualizations alongside the lyrics

## Response Fields

* `aligned_words` (array): List of lyric words with timing information
  * `word` (string): The lyric text, may include section markers like `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`
  * `start_s` (number): Word start time in seconds
  * `end_s` (number): Word end time in seconds
  * `success` (boolean): Whether the word was successfully aligned
  * `palign` (number): Alignment confidence score

* `waveform_data` (array): Numerical data for audio waveform visualization

* `hoot_cer` (number): Alignment precision score (Character Error Rate)

* `is_streamed` (boolean): Indicates if the audio is a streamed track
