<Tip>
  1. After submission, a `task_id` will be returned. If you provided a `callback_url`, when the task status becomes `finished` or `failed`, a POST request will be sent to the `callback_url`.
  2. Regardless of whether `callback_url` is provided, you can retrieve the response result through the unified [Query Music Detail](/api-manual/music-series/query-music-detail) endpoint.

  * `title`: Name for the generated track

  * `tags`: Desired musical styles (e.g., "relaxing, piano, soothing")

  * `negative_tags`: Styles to exclude (e.g., "heavy metal, fast drums")

  * **V5**: Superior musical expressiveness with faster generation

  * **V4\_5PLUS**: Enhanced tonal richness (default)
