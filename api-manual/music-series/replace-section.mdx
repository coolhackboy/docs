## Usage Guide

- This endpoint replaces a specific time range of an existing music track with new content
- Useful for editing verses, choruses, or any specific part of a generated track
- The replacement content is generated based on your prompt and style tags

## Parameter Details

- `task_id` (required): The original task ID from a completed music generation
- `audio_id` (required): The specific audio track identifier from the callback data

- `infill_start_s` (required): Start time in seconds (minimum 0, up to 2 decimals)
- `infill_end_s` (required): End time in seconds (must be greater than start time)

## Developer Notes

- Ensure `infill_end_s` is always greater than `infill_start_s`
- The time range should be within the duration of the original track
- Use `full_lyrics` when you want to maintain lyrical consistency across the entire track

## Optional parameters
