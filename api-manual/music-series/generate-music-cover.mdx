description: "Create cover images for generated music."
openapi: "/api-manual/music-series/generate-music-cover.json POST /api/generate/submit"

<Tip>
1. After submission, a `task_id` will be returned. If you provided a `callback_url`, when the task status becomes `finished` or `failed`, a POST request will be sent to the `callback_url`.
2. Regardless of whether `callback_url` is provided, you can retrieve the response result through the unified [Query Music Detail](/api-manual/music-series/query-music-detail) endpoint.

## Usage Guide

- This endpoint creates a cover version of an existing music track
- Requires a valid task_id from a previously generated music task
- The cover will be a new interpretation of the original track

## Parameter Details

- `task_id` (required): The task ID from a completed music generation task
  - Must be a valid task_id returned from the Generate Music or Extend Music endpoints
  - The original task must have completed successfully

## Developer Notes

- A cover can only be generated once per original task
- Results are delivered via the callback URL when processing is complete
