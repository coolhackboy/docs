<Tip>
1. After submission, a `task_id` will be returned. If you provided a `callback_url`, when the task status becomes `finished` or `failed`, a POST request will be sent to the `callback_url`.
2. Regardless of whether `callback_url` is provided, you can retrieve the response result through the unified [Query Music Detail](/api-manual/music-series/query-music-detail) endpoint.
</Tip>

## Usage Guide

- This endpoint converts generated music tracks to high-quality WAV format
- WAV files provide lossless audio quality for professional use
- The download URL for the WAV file is delivered via the callback

## Parameter Details

- `task_id` (required): Task ID from a completed music generation (Generate Music or Extend Music)
- `audio_id` (required): Specific audio track identifier from the callback data

## Developer Notes

- Each audio track can only be converted to WAV once
- The callback will include a download URL for the high-quality WAV file
- WAV files are significantly larger than compressed formats - plan storage accordingly
