## Usage Guide

- This endpoint creates a reusable musical persona from an existing audio track
- Personas capture the vocal style, genre characteristics, and musical personality
- Once created, personas can be used with the Generate Music endpoint via the `persona_id` parameter

## Parameter Details

- `task_id` (required): Task ID from a completed music generation (Generate, Extend, Upload Cover, or Upload Extend)
- `audio_id` (required): Specific audio track identifier from the callback data
- `name` (required): A descriptive name that captures the musical style or character
- `description` (required): Detailed description including:
  - Genre and mood
  - Instrumentation preferences
  - Vocal characteristics
  - Unique musical personality traits

## Developer Notes

- Each audio track can only have one persona created from it
- If a persona already exists for the audio, the API returns error code 409
- The returned `persona_id` can be used in subsequent Generate Music requests when Custom Mode is enabled
- Provide detailed descriptions for best results when using the persona
