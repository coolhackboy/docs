## Usage Guide

<Note>
The `task_id` parameter must be obtained from [Separate Vocals](/api-manual/music-series/vocal-remover/separate-vocals) or [Stem Split](/api-manual/music-series/vocal-remover/stem-split) endpoints.
</Note>

- This endpoint generates MIDI files from completed vocal separation tasks
- MIDI output includes detailed note information for each detected instrument

## Developer Notes

- MIDI generation requires a completed vocal separation as a prerequisite
- The callback delivers detailed note information for each detected instrument
- Callback endpoints must accept POST requests with JSON payloads
- You can also poll for results using the task status endpoint as an alternative to callbacks
