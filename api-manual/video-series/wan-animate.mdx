<Tip>
1. After submission, a `task_id` will be returned. If you provided a `callback_url`, when the task status becomes `finished` or `failed`, a POST request will be sent to the `callback_url`.
2. Regardless of whether `callback_url` is provided, you can retrieve the response result through the unified [Query Task Status](/api-manual/task-management/status) endpoint.

# Wan Animate Video Generation

Wan Animate is powered by Alibaba's Wan2.2-Animate model, a 14B parameter open-source model for digital human video generation. It accurately captures facial expressions and body movements from a reference video and applies them to a target image, enabling seamless character animation and replacement with realistic lighting and color preservation.

## Available Models

- **wan-animate-replace** - Replace a character in a video with one from a source image while preserving expressions and movements
- **wan-animate-move** - Animate a character image using motion from a reference video

## Resolution Options

- **480p** - Standard definition (default)
- **580p** - Enhanced definition
- **720p** - HD quality
